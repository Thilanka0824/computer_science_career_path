#Create a function called divisible_by_ten() that has one parameter named num.
#The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise. Consider using modulo operator % to check for divisibility.

# Write your divisible_by_ten() function here:
def divisible_by_ten(num):
    if (num % 10 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Uncomment these print() function calls to test your divisible_by_ten() function:

print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# should print True
print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False
