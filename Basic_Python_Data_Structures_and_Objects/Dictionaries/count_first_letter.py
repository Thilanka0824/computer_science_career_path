#Create a function named count_first_letter that takes a dictionary named names as a parameter. names should be a dictionary where the key is a last name and the value is a list of first names. For example, the dictionary might look like this:

# names = {"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Lannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}

# The function should return a new dictionary where each key is the first letter of a last name, and the value is the number of people whose last name begins with that letter.

# So in example above, the function would return:

# {"S" : 4, "L": 3}


# Write your count_first_letter function here:
def count_first_letter(names):
  letter_count = {}
  for key in names:
    first_letter = key[0]
    if first_letter not in letter_count:
        letter_count[first_letter] = 0
    letter_count[first_letter] += len(names[key])
  return letter_count

# Uncomment these function calls to test your  function:
print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Lannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 4, "L": 3}
print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Sannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 7}
